We next check our approximation on a more complex clustering task: clustering
time series, with a co-clustering matrix (and summaries thereof) as the quantity of interest.

%%
\noindent \textbf{Data and model.}
We use a publicly available data set of mice gene expression
\citep{shoemaker:2015:ultrasensitive}. Mice were infected with influenza virus,
and expression levels of a set of genes were assessed at 14 time points after
infection. Three measurements were taken at each time point (called biological
replicates), for a total of $\ntimepoints = 42$ measurements per gene.

The goal of the analysis is to cluster the time-course gene expression data
under the assumption that genes with similar time-course behavior may
have similar function.
Clustering gene expressions is often used for exploratory analysis
and is a first step before further downstream investigation.
It is important, therefore, to ascertain the
stability of the discovered clusters.

The left plot of \figref{example_genes} in \appref{app_mice}
shows the measurements of a single gene over time.
We model each gene as belonging to a latent component,
where each component defines a smooth expression curve over time.
Then, observations are drawn by adding i.i.d.\ noise to the smoothed
curve along with a gene-specific offset.
Following \citet{Luan:2003:clustering}, we construct the smoothers
using cubic B-splines.

Let $\x_\n\in\mathbb{R}^\ntimepoints$ be measurements of gene $\n$ at
$\ntimepoints$ time points. Let $\regmatrix$ be the $\ntimepoints \times \d$
B-spline regressor matrix, so that the $ij$-th entry of $\regmatrix$ is the
$j$-th B-spline basis vector evaluated at the $i$-th time point. The right plot
of \figref{example_genes} in \appref{app_mice} shows the B-spline basis.
The distribution of the data
arising from component $k$ is
%
\begin{align}\eqlabel{mice_model}
\p(\x_\n | \beta_\k, \b_\n) =
\normdist{\x_\n | \regmatrix\mu_\k + \b_\n,
\tau_\k^{-1}I_{\ntimepoints \times \ntimepoints}},
\end{align}
%
where $\b_\n$ is a gene-specific additive offset and $I$ is the identity matrix.
We include the additive offset because we
are interested in clustering gene expressions based on their patterns over time,
not their absolute level.
In this model, the component-specific parameters are $\beta_\k = (\mu_\k, \tau_\k)$,
the regression coefficients and the inverse noise variance.
The component frequencies are determined by stick-breaking according to $\nu$, and 
cluster assignments $z$ are drawn as in \secref{model_bnp}.
We use $\p(\nu_\k\vert\alpha_0) = \betadist{\nu_\k \vert 1, \alpha_0}$
with $\alpha_0 = 6$ as the initial stick-breaking prior.
%
%The mixture weights $\pi$ and cluster assignments $\z$ are drawn from the
%stick-breaking process described in \secref{model_bnp}.

Our variational approximation factorizes similarly to \eqref{vb_mf}
except with an additional factor for the additive shift.
In our variational approximation, we also make a simplification by letting
$\q(\beta_\k \vert \eta) = \delta (\beta_k \vert \eta)$,
where $\delta(\cdot \vert \eta)$ denotes a point mass at a parameterized location.
See \appref{app_mice} for further details concerning the model and
variational approximation.

%%
\noindent \textbf{Quantity of interest: the co-clustering matrix and summaries.}
In this application,
we are particularly interested in which genes cluster together,
so we focus on the posterior co-clustering
matrix.  Let $\gcoclustering(\eta)\in\mathbb{R}^{\N\times\N}$ denote the matrix
whose $(i,j)$-th entry is the posterior probability that gene $i$ belongs to the
same cluster as gene $j$, given by
%
\begin{align*}
%
[\gcoclustering(\eta)]_{ij} =
\expect{\q(\z\vert\eta)}{\ind{\z_{i} = \z_{j}}}  =
\begin{cases}
\sum_{k=1}^{\kmax}\left(\expect{\q(\z_i\vert\eta)}{\z_{ik}}
\expect{\q(\z_j\vert\eta)}{\z_{jk}}\right)
& \text{for } i \not= j\\
1 & \text{for } i = j
\end{cases}.
%
\end{align*}
\figref{gene_initial_coclustering} shows the inferred
co-clustering matrix at $\alpha_0$.

Below, we will use the influence function (\coryref{etafun_worst_case}) to try
and find a perturbation that produces large changes in the co-clustering matrix.
To compute the worst-case perturbation, we must choose a univariate summary of
the $\ngenes^2$-dimensional co-clustering matrix whose derivative we wish to
extremize. We use the sum of the eigenvalues of the symmetrically normalized
graph Laplacian, as given by
%
\begin{align*} \laplacianevsum(\eta) = \text{Tr}\left( I - D(\eta)^{-1/2}
\gcoclustering(\eta) D(\eta)^{-1/2} \right), \end{align*}
%
where $D(\eta)^{-1/2}$ is the diagonal matrix with entries $d_i =
\sum_{j=1}^{\ngenes}[\gcoclustering(\eta)]_{ij}$. The quantity $\laplacianevsum$
is differentiable, and has close connection with the number of distinct
components in a graph~\citep{luxburg:2007:spectralcluster}. We expect that prior
perturbations that produce large changes in $\laplacianevsum$ will also produce large changes in the full co-clustering matrix.

%%
\noindent \textbf{Sensitivity to the concentration parameter.}
We first evaluate the sensitivity of the co-clustering matrix $\gcoclustering$
to the choice of $\alpha$ in the stick-breaking prior.

We use the linear approximation to extrapolate the co-clustering matrix
under prior parameters
$\alpha = 0.1$ and $\alpha = 12$.
The a priori expected number of clusters in the original data at these values 
is 2 and 50, respectively. \textcolor{red}{what is it at $\alpha_0$?}
%At $\alpha = alpha_pert1$, only two clusters are expected
%{\em a priori} under the GEM prior;
%at $\alpha = alpha_pert2$, more than fifty are expected.
Despite this wide prior range, the change in the posterior
co-clustering matrix for each $\alpha$ is minuscule (\figref{gene_alpha_coclustering}). The
largest absolute changes in the co-clustering matrix is of order $10^{-2}$.
Refitting the approximate posterior at $\alpha = 0.1$ and
$\alpha = 12$ confirms the insensitivity predicted by the
linearized variational global parameters. Beyond capturing insensitivity, the
linearized parameters were also able to capture the sign and size of the
changes in the individual entries of the co-clustering matrix, even though these
changes are small.

\noindent \textbf{Sensitivity to functional perturbations.}
We now investigate sensitivity of the co-clustering matrix
to deviations from the beta prior.
In \figref{gene_fpert_coclustering}, we use the influence function for
$\laplacianevsum$ to construct a nonparametric prior perturbation that we
expect to have a large, positive effect.  The resulting prior does indeed
produce changes an order of magnitude larger than those produced by $\alpha$
perturbations shown in \figref{gene_alpha_coclustering}, and our approximation
is again able to capture the qualitative changes.
The influence function is also able to
explain why $\alpha$ perturbations were unable to produce large changes in this
case: \figref{alpha_pert_logphi} shows that changing $\alpha$ (as in
\exref{beta_inf_norm}) induces large changes in the prior only where the
influence function is small.

However, even with the (unreasonable-looking) selected functional perturbation,
the size of the differences in the co-clustering matrix remains modest. It is
unlikely that any scientific conclusions derived from the co-clustering matrix would have
changed after the functional perturbation. The co-clustering matrix appears
robust to perturbations in the stick-breaking distribution.
