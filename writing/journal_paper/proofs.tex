When \assuref{q_regular} holds, we have the following results.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{logq_derivs}
%
Define
%
\begin{align*}
%
\lqgradbar{\zeta \vert \eta} :={}& \lqgrad{\zeta \vert \eta}
  - \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}{\lqgrad{\zeta \vert \eta}} \\
\lqhessbar{\zeta \vert \eta} :={}& \lqhess{\zeta \vert \eta}
 - \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}{\lqhess{\zeta \vert \eta}} \\
\overline{\psi(\zeta)} :={}& \psi(\zeta)
 - \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}{\psi(\zeta)}.
%
\end{align*}
%
Then, under \assuref{q_regular}, we can apply \citet[Theorem
1]{giordano:2018:covariances} to rewrite the following derivatives as functions
of expectations.
%
\begin{align}\eqlabel{q_sens_is_cov}
%
\fracat{\partial \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}
              {\psi(\zeta)}}{\partial \eta}{\eta} ={}&
\expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}
       {\lqgradbar{\zeta \vert \eta} \overline{\psi(\zeta)}}.
%
\end{align}
%
Using the product rule and differentiating \eqref{q_sens_is_cov} again using
gives
%
\begin{align}\eqlabel{q_score_sens_is_cov}
%
%\MoveEqLeft
\fracat{\partial^2 \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}
              {\psi(\zeta)}}{\partial \eta \partial \eta^2}{\eta} ={}&
\expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}
       {\lqgradbar{\zeta \vert \eta} \lqgradbar{\zeta \vert \eta}^T
        \overline{\psi(\zeta)} } +
\nonumber\\&
\expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}{
       \lqhessbar{\zeta \vert \eta}
        \overline{\psi(\zeta)}
       }.
%
\end{align}
%
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{logq_continuous}
%
Under \assuref{q_regular}, the following are continuous functions of
$\eta$ in $\ball_\eta$:
%
\begin{align*}
%
\eta \mapsto{}& \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}{\psi(\zeta)} \mathand
%
\eta \mapsto{}&
    \fracat{\partial \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}
              {\psi(\zeta)}}{\partial \eta}{\eta} \mathand
\eta \mapsto{}&
    \fracat{\partial^2 \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}
                  {\psi(\zeta)}}{\partial \eta \partial \eta^2}{\eta}.
%
\end{align*}
%
\begin{proof}
%
By \assuref{q_regular}, $\q(\zeta \vert \eta) \psi(\zeta) < M(\zeta)$, so we can
apply continuity of $\eta \mapsto \q(\zeta \vert \eta)$ and the Lebesgue dominated
convergence theorem (CITE DUDLEY) to get
%
\begin{align*}
%
\lim_{\eta' \rightarrow \eta}
\abs{ \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta)}{\psi(\zeta)} -
      \expect{\q(\zeta \vert \eta')}{\psi(\zeta)}} \le{}&
\lim_{\eta' \rightarrow \eta}
\int \abs{\psi(\zeta)}
        \abs{\q(\zeta \vert \eta) -
             \q(\zeta \vert \eta')}\lambda(d\zeta) \\={}&
\int \abs{\psi(\zeta)}
    \lim_{\eta' \rightarrow \eta}
     \abs{\q(\zeta \vert \eta) -
          \q(\zeta \vert \eta')}\lambda(d\zeta) \\={}& 0.
%
\end{align*}
%
Applying analogous reasoning to \eqref{q_sens_is_cov, q_score_sens_is_cov}
gives the remainig results.
%
\end{proof}
