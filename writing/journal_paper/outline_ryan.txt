- Should we move the details of the variational approximation to the
appendix?  (Specifically --- conditional conjugacy, GH, and interior sticks)?

- Observe that we write "KL" even when it's not an actual KL divergence
(GH quadrature, point mass approximations).  This or define a quantity for
the objective function.

- Introduce the prior perturbation and definition (density WRT base measure
earlier on).  Also you can define the multiplicative perturbation there, too.

Can we introduce sensitivity right after we introduce the variational
approximation?

Can we move the other examples of BNP models later in the paper, in order to
move the main results up?

Can we introduce the parameterization by t right away when we introduce the
stick breaking density?  This will allow us to parameterize the VB approxiation
by t right away, too.
