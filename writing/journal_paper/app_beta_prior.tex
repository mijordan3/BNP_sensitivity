In the iris experiment, we considered $\alpha\in[0.1, 4.0]$.
Over this range, the shape of
the $\betadist{1, \alpha}$ stick-breaking density varies considerably, as shown in
\figref{beta_priors}.

To help us understand the effect of the concentration parameter
$\alpha$ we often use the following fact. Under the $\gem$ prior, the {\em a priori} expected
number of distinct clusters in a dataset of size $N$ is given by
%
\begin{align}\eqlabel{prior_num_clusters}
\expect{\p(\z \vert \pi)\p(\pi \vert \alpha)}{\nclusters(\z)} =
\sum_{\n = 1}^\N \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \n - 1}.
\end{align}
