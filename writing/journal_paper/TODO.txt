notation for per-cluster distributions: p(x_n | \theta_k) <- p(x_n | \theta_k, z_{nk} = 1)?

the beta draws are stick-breaking **proportions**; the resulting stick lengths are the mixture weights.

Need to refer to reparameterization trick somewhere, either in results or elsewhere.
Maybe example 4 would be a good spot (where we define the VB approximation to the number of clusters).
e.g. "for posterior quantities whose expectations which cannot be provided in closed form
with respect to $\eta$, we use Monte Carlo estimates.
In particular, we use the reparameterization trick,
which allows us to condition on a set of random draws independent of $\eta$;
conditional on the random draws, $\g$ (or rather its Monte Carlo approximation)
is a deterministic, differentiable function of $\eta$. (see \appref{TODO})"
