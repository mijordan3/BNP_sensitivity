notation for per-cluster distributions: p(x_n | \theta_k) <- p(x_n | \theta_k, z_{nk} = 1)?

the beta draws are stick-breaking **proportions**; the resulting stick lengths are the mixture weights.

It's not correct to say the derivative is an inner product between the influence
function and perturbation, since the influence function itself may not be a
member of L_p (it's a member of the dual space, L_q).

If we're going to claim that the posterior is differentiable we should
prove it; I'm not aware of another proof.
