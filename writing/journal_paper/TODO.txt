notation for per-cluster distributions: p(x_n | \theta_k) <- p(x_n | \theta_k, z_{nk} = 1)?

the beta draws are stick-breaking **proportions**; the resulting stick lengths are the mixture weights.

It's not correct to say the derivative is an inner product between the influence
function and perturbation, since the influence function itself may not be a
member of L_p (it's a member of the dual space, L_q).

If we're going to claim that the posterior is differentiable we should
prove it; I'm not aware of another proof.

Need to refer to reparameterization trick somewhere, either in results or elsewhere.
Maybe example 4 would be a good spot (where we define the VB approximation to the number of clusters).
e.g. "for posterior quantities whose expectations which cannot be provided in closed form
with respect to $\eta$, we use Monte Carlo estimates.
In particular, we use the reparameterization trick,
which allows us to condition on a set of random draws independent of $\eta$;
conditional on the random draws, $\g$ (or rather its Monte Carlo approximation)
is a deterministic, differentiable function of $\eta$. (see \appref{TODO})"
