A variational density $\q(\zeta \vert \eta)$ defined relative to the dominating
measure $\lambda(\cdot)$ is regular if the following conditions hold in a
neighborhood $\ball_\eta$ of $\eta_0$:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item  The map $\eta \mapsto \log \q(\zeta \vert \eta)$ is twice continuously
differentiable.
%
\item  There exists an envelope function $M(\zeta)$, integrable with respect to
$\lambda$ with $\int M(\zeta) \lambda(d\zeta) < \infty$, such that
all of $\q(\zeta \vert \eta)$, $\q(\zeta \vert \eta) \norm{\lqgrad{\zeta \vert \eta}}_2$,
and $\q(\zeta \vert \eta) \norm{\lqhess{\zeta \vert \eta}}_2$ are
bounded by $M(\zeta)$ uniformly in $\zeta$.
%
\item We say that $\q(\zeta \vert \eta)$ is regular for a function $\psi(\zeta):
\mathbb{R}^\zetadim \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ if $\q(\zeta \vert \eta)
\abs{\psi(\zeta)}$ and $\q(\zeta \vert \eta) \norm{\lqgrad{\zeta \vert
\eta}}_2^2 \abs{\psi(\zeta)}$ are also bounded by $M(\zeta)$ uniformly in
$\zeta$.
