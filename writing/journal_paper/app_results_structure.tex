The posterior quantities of interest in this application are the admixtures
$\pi_\n$. \figref{stru_init_fit} plots the inferred admixtures
$\expect{\q(\pi_\n \vert \etaopt)}{\pi_\n}$ for all individuals $\n$.

In the approximate posterior with $\alpha_0$, there appear to be three dominant
latent populations, which we arbitrarily label as populations 1, 2, and 3
(\figref{stru_init_fit}). The inferred admixture proportions generally
correspond with geographic regions: Mbololo individuals are primarily population
1; Ngangao individuals are primarily population 2; and Chawia individuals are a
mixture of populations 1, 2, and 3.
