The data sets we considered in our experiments had varying degrees
of complexity, 
and the computational of cost of fitting the variational approximation 
thus also varies accordingly. 
However, in each experiment, the cost of forming the linear approximation 
is rougly an order of magnitude faster than refitting (\tabref{timing_table})

For example, in the thrush data and topic model,
the initial fit took seven seconds, with subsequent refits
(which recall were warm-started with the initial fit) taking
between five and ten seconds.
Inverting the Hessian to form the linear approximation takes less than a second.
In all the examples, after forming the linear approximation, 
extrapolating to a new $\alpha$ or a 
perturbation $\phi$ takes \sfrac{1}{1000}th of a second. 


In each data set and model we consider, the the speed of the linear
approximation allows us to quickly explore a wide range of possible prior perturbations. 
However, even with the speed of our approximation, refitting for all possible perturbations is impossible.
The influence function, which is also cheap to compute, 
can thus provide a guide to uncover influential perturbations, 
at which we can then refit the model. 



% For example, in the mice data and regression model, 
% the initial fit took 30 seconds, with subsequent refits
% (which recall were warm-started with the initial fit) taking 
% between 20 and 30 seconds. 
% Inverting the Hessian to form the linear approximation three seconds. 
% Computing the influence function also takes less than a second.

Reported times for $\etaopt(\alpha)$ and $\etalin(\alpha)$ are 
median times over the set of considered $\alpha$'s.
The reported influence function time is the time required to
