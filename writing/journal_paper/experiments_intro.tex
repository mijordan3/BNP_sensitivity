We next evaluate our sensitivity approximations on three real data sets,
each with a different model using stick-breaking.
We find that our approximations largely agree with ground truth obtained by re-running the VB optimization, but
with the evaluation of our derivative an order of magnitude faster than
re-optimizing for a given perturbation.
