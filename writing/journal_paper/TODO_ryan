The prior must be defined for t in an open neighborhood of 0; for functional
perturbations unbounded above we require t to be positive.

Use either vert or commas for \lqgrad and \lqhess

Decide whether you want to simplify the formulas by requiring that
q be a density.

Put the p back in the perturbation definition.

Fix directionally differnetiable to be only at a particular point, or
smooth the KL divergence.

Either say Frechet and Gateaux or bounded and directional?

Let's be notationally consistent about whether a distribuiton is normalized.
Say, take tilde over the density?

When using MoveEqLeft precede lines with the inequalties

Put back in the factor of p^{-1} in the NL perturbation

Drop the rho from the defintion of the nonlinear perturbations

Don't use alpha in \pertset; reserve it for stick breaking

Fix your essinf notation, maybe \theta \sim \mu

Do not scale the set of phi produced by priors by beta

Fix the sign on KL divergence --- the prior enters with a negative sign

Go through and check carefully that the perturbations are the difference
in priors not the new prior.

Observe that we write "KL" even when it's not an actual KL divergence
(GH quadrature, point mass approximations).  This or define a quantity for
the objective function.

Refer to the stick-breaking "density", not "distribution"

Write GEM(\alpha) everywhere
