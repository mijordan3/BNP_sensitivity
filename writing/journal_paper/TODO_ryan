The prior must be defined for t in an open neighborhood of 0; for functional
perturbations unbounded above we require t to be positive.

Use either vert or commas for \lqgrad and \lqhess

Decide whether you want to simplify the formulas by requiring that
q be a density.

Put the p back in the perturbation definition.

Fix directionally differnetiable to be only at a particular point, or
smooth the KL divergence.

Either say Frechet and Gateaux or bounded and directional?

Let's be notationally consistent about whether a distribuiton is normalized.
Say, take tilde over the density?

When using MoveEqLeft precede lines with the inequalties
