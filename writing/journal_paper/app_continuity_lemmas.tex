A standard consequence of the dominated convergence theorem is the ability to
exchange integration and differentiation.  Since we will use this result
frequently, we state it here in our own notation as \thmref{dct}.

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{dct}
\citep[Theorem 16.8]{billingsley:1986:probability}
%
Let $\mu$ be sigma-finite measure on $\thetadom$, and let $S_\t \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$.  Let $f:\thetadom \times S_\t \mapsto \mathbb{R}$.

If there exists a function $M(\theta)$ with $\int M(\theta) \mu(d\theta) <
\infty$ such that $\abs{f(\theta, \t)} \le M(\theta)$, $\mu$-almost surely,
for all $\t \in S_\t$, then the map $\t \mapsto \int f(\theta, \t)
\mu(d\theta)$ is continuous.

Further, suppose that the derivative $\fracat{\partial f(\theta, \t)}{\partial
\t}{\t}$ exist $\mu$-almost surely for $\t \in S_\t$.  If there exists
an $M'(\theta)$ such that $\int M'(\theta) \mu(d\theta) < \infty$ and
$\abs{\fracat{\partial f(\theta, \t)}{\partial \t}{\t}} \le M'(\theta)$,
$\mu$-almost surely and for all $\t \in S_\t$, then
%
\begin{align*}
%
\fracat{\partial \int f(\theta, \t) \mu(d\theta)}{\partial \t}{\t} =
     \int \fracat{\partial f(\theta, \t)}{\partial \t}{\t} \mu(d\theta).

\proofof{\lemref{exchange_order}}\prooflabel{exchange_order}

Let $\eta_d$ denote the $d-$th entry of the vector $\eta$.  Then
$\abs{\partial f(\theta, \eta, \t) / \partial \eta_d} \le
  \norm{\partial f(\theta, \eta, \t) / \partial \eta}_2$
,
$\abs{\partial^2 f(\theta, \eta, \t) / \partial \eta_d \partial \t} \le
    \norm{\partial f(\theta, \eta, \t) / \partial \eta \partial \t}_2$,
and
$\abs{\partial^2 f(\theta, \eta, \t) /
       \partial \eta_{d_1} \partial \eta_{d_2}} \le
     \norm{\partial f(\theta, \eta, \t) / \partial \eta \partial\eta^T}_2$.
%
The conclusion follows by repeatedly applying \thmref{dct} to the components
of the derivatives.

%
\begin{proof}
%
The proof follows by repeatedly using \thmref{dct} to interchange the order of
integration and differentiation as in  \citep[Theorem
1]{giordano:2018:covariances}, from which \eqref{q_sens_is_cov} follows
directly.  \Eqref{q_sens_psi_grad_is_cov} follows by applying
\assuref{exchange_order} to \eqref{q_sens_is_cov}.

To compute \eqref{q_score_sens_is_cov}, we differentiate \eqref{q_sens_is_cov}
with respect to $\eta$, which involves terms of the form $\expect{\q(\theta
\vert \eta)}{\lqgrad{\theta \vert \eta}}$ and $\expect{\q(\theta \vert
\eta)}{\lqgrad{\theta \vert \eta} \psi(\theta, \t)}$.  For both of these terms,
we can exchange the order of the expectation and differentiation by
\assuref{exchange_order}.  \Eqref{q_score_sens_is_cov} then follows by
differentiating and collecting terms.

TODO: you need to assume the dominated version, \assuref{exchange_order}
is not enough.

TODO: Prove separately the continuiuty and differentiability of $\eta, \t
\mapsto \int \qtil(\theta \vert \eta) \psi(\theta, \t) \mu(d\theta)$ and of
$\eta \mapsto \int \qtil(\theta \vert \eta) \mu(d\theta)$.


%
\begin{proof}[Proof of \lemref{logq_continuous}]\prooflabel{logq_continuous}
%
By \lemref{logq_derivs}, the mixed partial $ \eta, \t \mapsto \fracat{\partial^2
\expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta)} {\psi(\theta, \t)}}{\partial \eta \partial
\t}{\eta, \t}$ is a continuous combination of the terms
%
$\expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta)}
       {\lqgrad{\theta \vert \eta} \psigrad{\theta,\t}}$,
%
$\expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta)}
      {\lqgrad{\theta \vert \eta}}$, and
%
$\expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta)}
    {\psigrad{\theta,\t}}$.
%
By \assuref{exchange_order}, each of these expressions is continuous.  For
example,
%
\begin{align*}
%
\MoveEqLeft
\norm{\expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta)}
       {\lqgrad{\theta \vert \eta} \psigrad{\theta,\t}} -

%
By ACTUALLY WE NEED THIS ASSUMPTION we can apply the dominated
convergence theorem to
each term in the final line of the preceding display, giving
%
\begin{align*}
%
\MoveEqLeft
\lim_{\eta' \rightarrow \eta} \lim_{\t' \rightarrow \t}

       {\lqgrad{\theta \vert \eta} \psigrad{\theta,\t}} -
   \expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta')}

      }_2 \\\le{}&
%
\int \lim_{\eta' \rightarrow \eta} \lim_{\t' \rightarrow \t} \norm{

\int \lim_{\eta' \rightarrow \eta} \lim_{\t' \rightarrow \t} \norm{

    \left( \psigrad{\theta, \t} - \psigrad{\theta, \t'} \right)
}_2 \mu(d\theta) = 0,
%
\end{align*}
%
the final equality following from the continuity assumptions of
\assuref{dist_fun_nice}.

Similarly, $\fracat{\partial^2
\expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta)} {\psi(\theta, \t)}}{\partial \eta \partial
\eta^T}{\eta}$ involves terms of the form
%
\begin{align*}
%
\expect{\q(\theta \vert \eta)}

to which we can apply \thmref{dct} by the corresponding assumption.  Reasoning
analogously to the other term, the conclusion follows.

Next, we prove a result for directional derivatives in $\lp{p}$ spaces.

%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{lem}\lemlabel{lp_integral_bound}
% %
% Under \assuref{lp_regular}, if $\norm{\gamma}_{\pbase, p} < \infty$

% exists an $M(\theta)$ with $\int M(\theta) \mu(d\theta) < \infty$
% such that, for all $0 \le \t \le (2 \abs{\inf_\theta \gamma(\theta)})^{-1}$,
% %
% \begin{align}
% %

% \abs{\psi(\theta)}\abs{\frac{\t \gamma(\theta)}{1 + \t \gamma(\theta)}}\q(\theta)
%     <{}& M(\theta). \eqlabel{lp_integral_deriv_bound}
% %
% \end{align}
% %
% \begin{proof}
%
% Let $\t_{max} := (2 \abs{\inf_\theta \gamma(\theta)})^{-1}$.  Then
% %
% \begin{align*}
% %
% 1 + \t \gamma(\theta) \ge{}& 1 - \t \abs{\inf_\theta \gamma(\theta)}
% \\={}
%     1 - \frac{\t}{2 \t_{max}}.
% %
% \end{align*}
% %
% So $\t \le \t_{max} \Rightarrow 1 + \t \gamma(\theta) \ge 1/2$ for all $\theta$.
% Expanding the integral,
% %
% \begin{align*}
% %
% \MoveEqLeft
% \int \abs{\psi(\theta)}

% \norm{\gamma}_{\pbase,p}.
% %
% \end{align*}
% %
% By assumption, the final equation in the preceding display is finite, and the
% second line does not depend on $\t$, so we have proven the existence of an

%
% For \eqref{lp_integral_deriv_bound} observe that $\t \le \t_{max}$ implies

The next lemma is a different kind of continuity lemma.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{continuity_partition}
%
Let $\epsilon'_n = n^{-1}$.  Since $\pbase \ll \mu \ll \lambda$ (where $\lambda$
is the Lebesgue measure), by applying \citet[Proposition
15.5]{nielsen:1997:measure}, for each $n$ there exists a $\delta'_n$ such that,
for any measureable set $A$ with $\mu(A) < \delta'_n$, $\pbase(A) <
\epsilon'_n$.  Again applying \citet[Proposition 15.5]{nielsen:1997:measure},
there similarly exists a $\delta_n$ such that for any measureable set $A$ with
$\lambda(A) < \delta_n$, $\mu(A) < \delta'_n \Rightarrow \pbase(A) <
\epsilon'_n$.

For each $n$, partition $\thetadom$ into a countable number of sets $A_{m}$ such
that $\sum_{m} \lambda(A_{m}) = 1$ and $\lambda(A_{m}) < \delta_n$. (This is
possible by dividing $\thetadom$ into sufficiently small rectangles, for
example.)  Then $\pbase(A_{m}) < \epsilon'_n$ for all $m$.  Since $\pbase$ is a
probability measure, $\sum_m \pbase(A_{m}) = 1$, so there must exist at least $1 /
\epsilon'_n$ indices $m'$ such that $\pbase(A_{m'}) > 0$. Take any such $m'$ and
let $\epsilon_n = \pbase(A_{m'})$ and $S_n = A_{m'}$.
