A Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) approach to clustering allows for posterior
inference without specifying the number of components {\em a priori}.  In
practice, the particular form of the BNP prior is often chosen for mathematical
convenience, and it is important to detect when conclusions are sensitive to
arbitrary prior choices.

We approximate the dependence of a variational Bayes approximation to a BNP
model with a first-order Taylor series, both for parametric perturbations (e.g.,
to the concentration parameter of a GEM prior) and for nonparametric
perturbations to a stick-breaking density.  We state general conditions under
which a VB approximation is continuously Fr{\'e}chet differentiable and
validate the accuracy and utility of our approximation on several real-world
datasets.
